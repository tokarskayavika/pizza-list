# Pizza List application

The application shows a form for adding an item on the list of chosen items. All data stays in local storage. Also requests for restaurants and products either use cached result or fetch data from the server. Field 'price' is editable, so that summary is recalculated each time. Also, there is a posibility of deletion a row in a table.

From technical point of view, I used React, Typescript, Redux/Toolkit, Material UI and react-select library, but not Async Select intentionally.

Please run:

### `npm install`

And

### `npm start`

Here is the screenshot!
